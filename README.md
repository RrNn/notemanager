### JS Note Manager.

- This is a Notemanager that uses JS data strucures to store the notes, so, don't refresh your page :wink:
- To run it, clone the repo and open the `public/index.html` file in a browser.
- You can browse thru the files. If you add anything remember to compile it. The compiled
  assets are in `public/css` and `public/js` folders respectively.
- Run `yarn dev` to compile your assest, or `yarn watch` to watch over them :grinning:
- You can view the demo here https://rrnn.github.io/notemanager/
